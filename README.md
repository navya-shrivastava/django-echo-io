# django-echo-io

Welcome to Echoio! This is a django based college project made by us.

Echoio is an online discussion forum where users can discuss any topic with like-minded people. It is an internet-based group community where users can start a discussion, get an answer to their query, or search for new business prospects. These forums allow users to register with them and look into the answers to various questions written by others or they themselves can answer the questions. They create threaded discussions that can spawn a discussion tree where the discussion branches out in many directions or sub-threads.
